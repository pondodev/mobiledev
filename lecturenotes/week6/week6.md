# mobile dev week 6 lecture notes

## user experience, design, and sketching

- user experience
  - very broad field of study
- human-computer interaction
  - an area focusing on the interfaces between humans and computers (not just guis)
- cognitive psychology
- physical ergonomics
- cognitive ergonomics

- designing is a process, usually involving the following:
  - ideation
  - planning
  - drafing
  - outlining
  - diagramming
  - drawing
  - sketching
  - $?$?$?$?

  - bottom up
    - specific features/tasks
    - "pain points"/requirments
    - more focused/directed
    - product is defines clearer
    - risks being limited/rigid
- top down
  - vision/mission statements
  - more freedom and flexibility
  - product can evolve
  - risks being non-specific/vague

- we need to think more about the interaction with a device than the interaction itself
- WIMP
  - windows
  - icon
  - menu
  - pointer
- post-WIMP
  - gesture interfaces
  - voice ui
  - tangible ui
  - ar
  - vr

## cognitive ergonomics

- how well our solution matches the cognative capabilities of our users
- mobile devices can interrupt our attention

## volatile memory limitations

- human memory is volatile
- there are 3 main memory types to consider:
  - sensory (1-3s)
  - short term/working (10-30s)
  - long term (potentially a lifetime)
- short term memroy is limited to remembering about (magical) 7 +/- 2 items (miller's law)
- there's also the magical number based on research 4 +/- 1 (cowan 2001)
